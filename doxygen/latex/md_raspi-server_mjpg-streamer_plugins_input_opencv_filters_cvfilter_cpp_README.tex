This is just a demonstration plugin that shows how to create a bare minimum filter plugin for use with the mjpg-\/streamer input\+\_\+opencv plugin.

To create your own filter plugin, just copy filter\+\_\+cpp.\+cpp to your own project, and compile/link it with the same build of Open\+C\+V that mjpg-\/streamer is linked to.

C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt is specific to the mjpg-\/streamer build tree, and won't be useful outside of it.
