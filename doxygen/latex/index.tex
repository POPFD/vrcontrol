\subsection*{Accessing Visual Studio Code in Rapiro-\/\+Pi}

Check to see if an instance is already open by hitting alt + tab or check the taskbar at the top (known bug sometimes disappears so use alt + tab or equivalent to O\+S you are on)


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item If an instance is not running open the terminal
\item Type {\ttfamily cd vscode} then hit enter
\item Type {\ttfamily ./scripts/code.sh} then hit enter (be patient takes a while to fully load U\+I)
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

N\+O\+T\+E\+: The terminal command {\ttfamily ./scripts/code.sh} is what runs V\+S code so if you need to make any commands in terminal open a new terminal instance. Be careful not to accidentally close the terminal running V\+S code or data could be lost (V\+S code autosave feature is turned on but it is not a guarantee to prevent data loss)
